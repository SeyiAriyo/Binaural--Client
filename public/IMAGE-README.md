All images have been moved into the Public > Static > Img Folder.

Please follow this path for ALL images; also, check to see if your image already exists.

Path for ALL images will be "static/img/example.png".

This is a public path so Vercel won't think that we are using them as an image hoster.

ALL screenshoots for the README.md should also go here but at this path:
"static/screenshots/example.png".
