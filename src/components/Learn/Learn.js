            <img src="static/img/delta.png" className="Delta" alt="" />
            <p>
            Neural waves in the delta pattern oscillate at a frequency range of 0.1–4 HZ and are most closely associated with deep stage 3 or “slow-wave” sleep.
            </p>
            <p>
            The use of binaural beats at this frequency can help users with detached awareness, sleep and memory formation.

            <img src="static/img/theta.png" className="Theta" alt="" />
            <p>
            Neural waves in the theta pattern oscillate at a frequency range of 4–7 HZ and are most closely associated with REM, or dreaming sleep.
            </p>
            <p>
            The use of binaural beats at this frequency can help users achieve states of meditation, intuition and memory formation.

            <p>
            Neural waves in the alpha pattern oscillate at a frequency range of 8–15 HZ and are most closely associated with the state of wakeful relaxation.
            </p>
            <p>
            The use of binaural beats at this frequency can help users achieve states of better relaxation, meditation and creativity.

            <p>
            Neural waves in the beta pattern oscillate at a frequency range of 16–31 HZ and are most closely associated with waking consciousness.
            </p>
            <p>
            The use of binaural beats at this frequency can help users achieve states of heightened alertness, concentration and cognition.

            <p>
            Neural waves in the gamma pattern oscillate at a frequency range of 32–100 HZ and are most closely associated with conscious attention.
            </p>
            <p>
            The use of binaural beats at this frequency can help users achieve states of increased insight, focus and expanded consciousness.
